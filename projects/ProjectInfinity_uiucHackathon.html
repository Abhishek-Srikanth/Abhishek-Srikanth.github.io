            This was a hardware project implemented on the Intel Edison chip at the UI-UC hackathon.
            The objective of the project was to use the Edison chip to host a game on multiple clients using a django based server.
            The game running on the client side system was controlled by an accelerometer whose values were
            processed and readied for access by the Edison so that the client side javascript may update the game window.
            <br><br>
            The project currently supports infinte clients whose game characters are controlled by the individual accelerometer.
            It is imaged to scale so that the chip could act as an individual entity that can support multiple users and provide input
             that extends more than the likes of a game.
            <br><br>
            We managed to win 1st place in Intel's competition of best use of Intel Edison for IoT and hardware hacks.

        <p>
            In the Following simulation, a few assumptions have been made:
            <ul>
                <li>The player (blue) does not have his direction set</li>
                <li>No input is provided, hence players constantly move straight</li>
                <li>Game runs infinitely, this is simply to demo how it would look</li>
