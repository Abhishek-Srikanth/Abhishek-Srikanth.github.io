        This was the first big programming project I undertook. This program was meant to read an unsolved 9x9 sudokus by taking
        input from the user and then solving the same sudoku so that the user is provided with a completed sudoku.
        It also allowed the user to save the sudoku to file if needed.<br>

        The Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial numberplacement
        puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits
        so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids
        contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. An additional
        constraint on the contents of individual regions is that the same
        single integer may not appear twice in the same 9×9 playing
        board row or column or in any of the nine 3×3 sub-regions of
        the 9×9 playing board.<br><br>
        The puzzle was popularized in 1986 by the Japanese puzzle
        company Nikoli, under the name Sudoku, meaning single
        number. It became an international hit in 2005.<br><br>
        There a total of 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 possible
        permutations. This number is equal to 9! × 722 × 27 ×
        27,704,267,971, the last factor of which is prime. The result
        was derived through logic and “brute force computation."

        <h1 class = "hide-for-large-up" style = "text-align:center; border-bottom:#000000 solid thin;">Challenges faced</h1>

        Designing the Algorithm for the Sudoku solver and determining the best way to have the data stored in memory for quick
        access was a major challenge. To solve the sudoku, initially each box had possible values set. All single possible values
        were saved as the value of the cell then. This process was repeated after every computation.<br><br>
        Besides this, frequency of numbers in rows, columns and sub-boxes(3x3) were measured and single frequency values were set.
        If sudoku was not solved by now, guesses were made and each newly guessed sudoku was attempted to be solved. This was
        carried on until the complete sudoku was solved.<br><br>
        Another challenge then was accessing each sub-box individually, and to do so a 1-4-7 co-ordinate system was created where
        1,4,7 represent the middle point of each 3x3 box.
