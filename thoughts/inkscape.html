        My day with Inkscape
    </h1> <br>

    Before I list out key tools I used today, the following were really helpful resources:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.chrishilbig.com/a-crash-course-in-inkscape/">Chris' tutorial</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX7Nbj1xFco&list=FL7GJcHyS3S4vsh7isCOLVtw&index=1">YouTube tutorial</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            The community online is really awesome too!
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    These tutorials by themselves majorly covered everything I used for my logo. 
    I wanted to list the tools I over-abused during my design process. 
    </p>

    <p>
    On the menu on the left, the <strong>rectangle tool</strong> was used a lot by me. The best part was the small circle that allowed rounding the edges.
    I found the <strong>pen tool</strong> for <u>straight lines</u> and <u>bezier lines</u> very useful too.
    The text tool is an essential that is hard to miss out on.
    The <strong>Edit Path by Nodes</strong> was helpful in fixing mistakes.
    </p>

    <p>
    With regards to sub menus, the <strong>Fill and stroke menu</strong> was used a lot to color objects and create gradients (majorly for shadows).
    The <strong>layers menu</strong> was essential is dividing logo into parts into layers allowing modification of parts at a time.
    The <strong>grid</strong> option was of great help in aligning elements on the logo.
    </p>

    Some things to note (for me) were: 
    <ol>
        <li> Convert text to objectToPath form </li>
        <li> Shadow can be implemented as a layer under object that requires one </li>
        <li> There is always a nifty hack (like the one i discoved on shadows) </li>
    </ol>
